## Blesh SDK at a glance

Blesh SDK is distributed as a library project for iOS and Android platforms. It's core purpose is to provide micro location information to the host application via our services. These services vary from displaying feature-rich content to simple micro location information. All you should do is to start our SDK, providing user specific settings dedicated to your application which you can obtain by contacting us. Therefore we have a quite simple integration phase and we are doing our best to keep it that way.

## Integrating Blesh SDK into your application
