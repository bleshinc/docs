### Blesh SDK at a glance

Blesh iBeacon SDK is distributed as a library project for iOS and Android platforms. It's core purpose is to provide micro location information to the host application via our services. These services vary from displaying feature-rich content to simple micro location information. All you should do is to start our service/framework, providing user specific settings dedicated to your application which you can obtain by contacting us. Therefore we have a quite simple integration phase and we are doing our best to keep it that way.

### Integrating Blesh SDK into your application

Integration process involves importing Blesh SDK library project into your application and starting Blesh service/framework. Please refer to our platform specific guides for more detail.
